# python-stock-prediction-program
A fun (crude) python project that implements a text based UI to get information stocks. The program also includes a prediction algorithm (very simple and not advised to use in the real world). 
Required modules: os, datetime, keyboard, sys, csv, yahoofin.stock_info (the program will attempt to install these modules if you don't have them installed, if this happens the program may not work on the first try, try running it again).
You can find a working implementation of the program here: http://www.charsetnul.org/map.html
